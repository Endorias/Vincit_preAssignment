# Vincit_preAssignment
Preassignment for the Vincit Rising Star program
This project hosted on heroku for the time being at the link ->  https://pre-project-endorias.herokuapp.com/

Requires a virtual environment to run optimally!
This can be achieved through executing these commands through terminal in the project folder: 
$ python -m venv venv/
$ source venv/bin/activate

Other than that the program can be run locally through running the app.py file. It should then host a local server to access the app itself. 

NOTE: All dates must be input at DD/MM/YYYY

have fun and enjoy!
